## Contributing

### Members

When contributing to the members list, you must follow two guidelines:

1. Follow the style of previous entries (fully qualified URL, entirely blank
   field if you don't specify a column, etc).
2. Put your name in where it fits alphabetically. The CSV is in alphabetical
   order.
